Overview
This MIPS Assembly program prompts the user to input two integers, validates the inputs, and performs a series of arithmetic operations on them: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program also checks if the two integers are equal or different and outputs relevant messages. Invalid inputs are handled with appropriate prompts to ensure correct input.
